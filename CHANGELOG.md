## 1.0.0
* Upgrade to the new JavaScript version of Parinfer. Everything should be much faster now.

## 0.10.0
* Prompt the user when first opening a file if Paren Mode didn't succeed or
  needs to make changes to the file. Issues [#18] and [#24].

## 0.6.0
* Re-write of atom-parinfer in ClojureScript

## 0.3.0
* Correctly watch the cursor for changes
* Cleaner event triggering

## 0.2.0 - First Release
* Initial release!
* Parinfer now usable in a major text editor. One small step for parenthesis,
  one giant leap for LISP ;)
